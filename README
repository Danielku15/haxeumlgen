HaxeUmlGen generates class diagrams dynamically for a haXe project.
HaxeUmlGen uses Graphviz to draw the diagram, so graphviz must be
installed and the binary must be added to the path.  Graphviz is a
free program that can be found at http://www.graphviz.org.


USAGE

HaxeUmlGen uses the xml file created when the -xml flag is passed in
to the haxe compiler.  It can be run directly from haxelib.

  haxelib run HaxeUmlGen XMLFILE

where
  XMLFILE is the file that the haxe compiler created

For example, to generate diagrams of myproject, compile with

  haxe -neko myproject.n -xml myproject.xml MyProject.hx

then generate diagrams with

  haxelib run haxeumlgen myproject.xml

That will create a files called [packagename].png for each package in
the same directory as myproject.xml

The output directory can be changed with the --outdir command line
parameter.  Foreground and background colors can be changed with -f
COLOR and -b COLOR, respectively.  COLOR should be a six character hex
code, like color specifications for html.  Don't quote colors or
prefix with a sharp (#).  Other parameters can be listed with

  neko haxeumlgen --help
