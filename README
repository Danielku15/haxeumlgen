HaxeUmlGen generates class diagrams dynamically for a haXe project.
HaxeUmlGen uses Graphviz to draw the diagram, so graphviz must be
installed and the binary must be added to the path.  Graphviz is a
free program that can be found at http://www.graphviz.org.

USAGE

HaxeUmlGen uses the xml file created when the -xml flag is passed in
to the haxe compiler.  After compiling, run

  neko haxeumlgen XMLFILE PACKAGE

where
  XMLFILE is the file that the haxe compiler created
  PACKAGE is the name of the package to be diagrammed

For example, to generate a diagram of the "some.package" package of
myproject, compile with

  haxe -neko myproject.n -xml myproject.xml MyProject.hx

then generate the diagram with

  neko haxeumlgen myproject.xml some.package

That will create a file called some.package.png in the same directory
as myproject.xml

The output directory can be changed with the --outdir command line
parameter.  Other parameters can be listed with

  neko haxeumlgen --help
